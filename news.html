               <p class="article-text">In the Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity game, you can see Hyrule 100 years before the events of the Legend of Zelda™: Breath of the Wild game (in a very action-y, “take on hundreds of enemies with really sharp objects” kind of way). You’ll play as Link, Zelda, the four Champions, and many more heroes as you set out to save Hyrule! Once you’re done with that meaty quest, there’s also sizable downloadable content to enjoy, including the brand-new Wave 2: Guardian of Remembrance. You’ll get access to both waves by purchasing the Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity Expansion Pass.</p>

               <p class="article-text">This year marks the 35th anniversary since the release of the original The Legend of Zelda game. Now, the Game & Watch: The Legend of Zelda system, featuring that game and other retro Legend of Zelda classics, is launching soon. To help celebrate, we’ll be diving into some secrets hidden within the system over the course of three articles. Our first article will examine some differences between the Japanese and western releases of the three games included in this system: The Legend of Zelda, Zelda II: The Adventure of Link:tm:, and The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening.</p>

               <p class="article-text">This year marks the 35th anniversary since the release of the original The Legend of Zelda game. Now, the Game & Watch: The Legend of Zelda system, featuring that game and other retro Legend of Zelda classics, is launching soon. In our second article, we’ll take a look at the clock and timer included with the system; in other words, the “watch” part of Game & Watch: The Legend of Zelda. Both the digital clock and countdown timer are themed after classic Legend of Zelda games, and both include some secrets, so let’s get started.</p>
